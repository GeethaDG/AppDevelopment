### Description

"When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month or even your year, but I'll be there for you". 
We know we could have been more original with this, but well, when it comes to being a true friend you can count on Bachat... Quite literally :p
Bachat will help you figure out how much you spend on shopping, groceries, entertainment and much more. Bachat is that friend who is there for you... Whenever, wherever and however! 

#### How does Bachat work?
"You can count on me like 1,2,3; I'll be there"... See a pattern developing here? Well so are we! Bachat is as familiar as these lyrics are to you and is just as catchy! 

Bachat works in a very simple way. The application allows you to log your expenses and incomes under different categories. You can choose or create sub-categories to further refine your entries. Once you have added transactions, you can set budgets for certain categories or even an overall monthly budget. Bachat will now help you monitor your budget throughout the month and have a firm grip on all your expenditures.

##### Why does Bachat need permissions:

We at Gingerbread believe in complete transparency with our users. We would not like any shady business as users ourselves and to give our client base the peace of mind that their personal data is always safe and never used against their will, we are going to give you a breakdown of where and exactly why we need to access certain things. 

###### 1) Bachat needs your permission to add a contact to a transaction (in case you have borrowed or lent money or have shared a transaction):

This is an optional feature and you can always opt to not provide the permission.

###### 2) Bachat needs your permission access your internal storage to import files into the app:

This is required if you are planning on importing your transaction details from a folder inside your phone's storage.

Again as with the above mentioned permission, this is an optional feature and you can always opt to not provide the permission if you do not wish for us to import your files.
